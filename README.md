Port Management
===============

We manage the Rotterdam port. Ships arrive daily. Every ship has a unique
identifier, composed of letters and digits.

A ship is loaded with containers. Every container has a unique number.
It is known if the contents of a container imply a fire and/or chemical hazard.

A ship may enter a dock. A dock can contain only one ship at a time.
On every dock, several people are employed, of which some are supervisors.
The first name, last name, address and bank account number of each employee
is known. Employees are assigned to a ship in the dock.

* An overview page that lists docks with their occupancy, and cargo hazards.

* A dock detail page with for example the employees, current ship, containers
and cargo hazards and a historic overview of ships
